                The primary mission of the City Library is to provide access to information of an
                educational and recreational nature for the residents of Fairfield and those areas contracting service
                with the library, to promote an informed citizenry and enrich lives. While all 18 Online Library Service
                Responses are addressed to varying degrees, we currently emphasize these three:
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            1. Create Young Readers—Early Literacy: Children from birth to age five will have programs and services
            designed to ensure that they will enter school ready to learn to read, write, and listen.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            2. Satisfy Curiosity—Lifelong Learning: Residents will have the resources they need to explore topics of
            personal interest and continue to learn throughout their lives.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            3. Understand How to Find, Evaluate, and Use Information—Information Fluency: Residents will know when
            they need information to resolve an issue or answer a question, and have the skills to search for,
            locate, evaluate, and effectively use information to meet their needs.</p>
